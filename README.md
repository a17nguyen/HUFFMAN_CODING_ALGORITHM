This file compression project implements the Huffman tree for lossless data compression. The Huffman coding algorithm implements a priority queue ADT

huffman.c: The huffman code that assigns variable-length codes to input characters based on its frequency. Utilizes priority queue of trees
pqueue.c: Priority queue ADT implementation using a binary heap implemented by an array
